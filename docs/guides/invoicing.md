# Invoicing

## Render a QR-bill

```bash
quints invoice invoicing/acme-2026-07.yaml
```

Writes a Swiss QR-bill PDF (domestic, or export/reverse-charge without QR
part) and cross-checks the total against your ledger: if the invoice is
already booked at a different amount, you get a conflict, not a silent
divergence. If it isn't booked yet, quints prints the draft transaction to
paste into `books/<year>.bean`.

An invoice is one YAML file:

```yaml
number: INV2026014
kind: domestic          # or export (reverse charge, no QR part)
currency: CHF
issue_date: 2026-07-02
supply: Juli 2026
customer:
  name: Acme AG
  address:
    - Bahnhofstrasse 1
    - 8001 Zürich
items:
  - description: Consulting — July
    quantity: 1
    unit_price: 1000.00
locale: de_CH
```

Issuer identity — name, address, VAT ID, IBAN/QR-IBAN per currency, logo —
lives once in `invoicing/issuer.yaml`. Repeat customers can live in
`invoicing/customers.yaml` and be referenced by key.

## Editor validation

```bash
quints schema
```

Writes JSON Schemas for the invoice, issuer, and customers files to
`invoicing/schema/`. Point your editor at them (yaml-language-server
modeline) for completion and validation while you write invoices.

## Who owes you

```bash
quints receivables
```

Open invoices against `Receivable:Trade`, grouped by invoice id, aged by due
date. An invoice disappears from the list when the payment leg is booked with
the same `^invoice-id` link.
